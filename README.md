## Building the Circuit
Lab 1 helped us gain familiarity with basic Arduino functionality and setup. First, I used the provided 'Blink_LED' sketch to make the LED on the Arduino Nano Every blink. This also served as a test of having connected the Arduino correctly and being able to upload code to it. Here's the code used (click to see the LED blinking):

Our final goal is to build a robot that is able to detect bright light and follow it. We will use CdS photoresistors to detect bright light. 

I started building the circuit that would be able to detect bright light and follow it. This setup includes two CdS photoresistors, one on each side of the arduino, that act as the 'eyes' of the robot.
